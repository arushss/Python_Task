'''
 Generator: A generator-function is defined like a normal function,
 but whenever it needs to generate a value, it does so with the yield keyword rather than return. 
 If the body of a def contains yield, the function automatically becomes a generator function.

 next: Retrieve the next item from the iterator by calling its __next__() method.
 If default is given, it is returned if the iterator is exhausted, otherwise StopIteration is raised.

 yield: Yield can produce a sequence of values. yield should be used when we want to iterate over a sequence, 
 but donâ€™t want to store the entire sequence in memory.
